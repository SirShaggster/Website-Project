# Website-Project
Harrison and Yiyang Jin's first full-stack built website

Welcome to Harrison and Yiyang Jin's code repository! We started this project at the beginning of summer 2025, and will see it to its completion, hopefully by the end of the summer. 

This is purely a passion project. Our love for weopons platforms, more from a technological and historical perspective than a politcal one, is the fuel behind this build. Our goal is to build a website with a rich database of various weopons without being too presentable. That is, we want users with a genuine passion to 'find' information for themselves by clicking around and interacting with the website.

Functionality will improve as time goes on. 

Enjoy!
